                    Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in
                    most breeds, and the wings are short.[18] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles
                    are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[19] Size and coloration vary widely
                    between breeds.[18] Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or
                    cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and
                    wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under
                    the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[20]

                    Chickens are omnivores.[21] In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and
                    animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[22] and young mice.[23] A chicken may live for 5â€“10
                    years, depending on the breed.[24] The world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.[25]

                    Chickens are gregarious, living in flocks, and incubate eggs and raise young communally. Individual
                    chickens dominate others, establishing a pecking order; dominant individuals take priority for
                    access to food and nest sites. <u style="color: blue;">The concept of dominance, involving pecking, was described in female
                    chickens by Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921 as the "pecking order".[26][27] Male chickens tend to
                    leap and use their claws in conflicts.[28] Chickens are capable of mobbing and killing a weak or
                    inexperienced predator, such as a young fox.[29] </u>

                    Crowing (with audio)
                    A male's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call, serving as a territorial signal to other
                    males,[30] and in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after
                    laying an egg and to call their chicks. Chickens give different warning calls to indicate that a
                    predator is approaching from the air or on the ground.
